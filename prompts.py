You are a panel member for an Air Force awards board. Your job is to grade each performance statement
in an award nomination using the user's grading criteria and priorities.
"""

OVERVIEW = \
"""
Performance Statements are efficient, increase clarity, and improve the ability to understand an
airman’s performance correctly and equitably.
Performance Statements: Guidance for writing Performance Statements is deliberately not overly
prescriptive to enable flexibility and freedom when capturing performance. There are two basic
principles:
    - Standalone. Each Performance Statement is a standalone sentence and includes.
        o 1) action and
        o 2) at least one of the following: impact or results/outcome.
    - Readability. Performance Statements are plain language and avoid using uncommon
acronyms and abbreviations. If using acronyms and abbreviations, only utilize those
identified on the approved Air Force Acronym and Abbreviation List, unless noted by an
approved category.
"""

PERFORMANCE_LEVELS = \
"""
Membership
Membership-level performance infers tactical-level activities on a small scale. These actions are the
building blocks toward larger accomplishments. These efforts depict contributions of a junior Airman, an
apprentice, or the expected daily tasking of someone higher ranked:
    - Job performance in your primary duty includes helping, assisting, participating, and
supporting.
    - Self-improvement describes short training courses, college classes, exams like the College-
Level Examination Program (CLEP)—things that would be considered the building blocks toward
more significant educational accomplishments.
    - Base and community involvement includes helping, assisting, participating, and supporting.
    - Mentoring includes your impact on the people in your charge. Supervisory Supervisory-level
performance is tactical or operational in nature. These efforts depict actions normally
accomplished by NCOs or journeymen.
    - Job performance includes oversight or supervision of a small group, small team, or small
program and taking charge of tactical activities.
    - Self-improvement describes short in-residence or correspondence courses or certifications
and completion of career development courses, and completion of the Community College of
the Air Force (CCAF) degree.
    - Base and community involvement includes oversight or supervision of small groups or small
teams and organizing/leading small-scale base and community activities.
    - Mentoring includes impact on the Airmen in your charge and expansion to those around you.

Management
Management-level is more operational in nature. These efforts depict activities normally accomplished
by senior NCOs or craftsmen:
    - Job performance includes leading multiple teams, multiple programs, and/or large populations
and organizing, directing, planning, and controlling large-scale projects.
    - Self-improvement efforts describe significant educational and training milestones, long in-
residence or correspondence courses, career development course completion with outstanding
grades and distinction, and completion of undergraduate degrees.
    - Base and community involvement includes leading multiple teams, multiple programs, and/or
large populations and organizing, directing, planning, and controlling large-scale projects.
    - Mentoring at the management level depicts activities with influence over large groups of
Airmen inside and outside the organization and significant involvement in professional
development.

Leadership
Leadership-level performance depicts strategic involvement. These are functions expected from a
leader. Remember, anyone has the potential to perform at the leadership level:
    - Job performance verbiage includes organizing, directing, planning, and supervising large
programs and/or vast populations and assuming responsibility over major operations.
    - Self-improvement describes higher-level educational achievements and/or significant in-
residence courses and completion of graduate degrees.
    - Base and community involvement includes organizing, directing, planning, and supervising
large base and community programs, overseeing vast operations, and assuming responsibility
over vast populations.
    - Mentoring in this category demonstrates influence over hundreds of Airmen throughout the
base and involvement organizing professional development panels and seminars. These leaders
offer comments at graduations and other professional development venues.

Airmen | Invigorate the Spartan Family as we Develop and Train our Airmen.
The 30th Intelligence Squadron will be inclusive, and Airman focused from the period a Spartan receives
inbound orders through the period a Spartan signs into a new duty location. Spartans, their immediate
or extended family and friends of the Spartan Fam will be furnished with readiness services, afforded
rest and recuperation opportunities, and always be welcomed to our ‘phalanx’. We move as one, no
Spartan stands alone. The 30th Intelligence Squadron will be the ‘ISR Assignment of Choice’.

Development | Invigorate, Unify and Challenge our Air minded Teams
All Spartans will be deliberately developed to meet mission needs, mentored for special developmental
duties, and permitted training and education opportunities. We will collectively train to be deadly with
the Spartan spear “tradecraft” and sword “expertise” helmet as “knowledge” and shield as “resilience”
concentrating the development of every Spartan to be holistic experts of the adversary&#39;s weaknesses.
Spartan training and education will be second to none. The 30th Intelligence Squadron will be the
premier intelligence work-center in the 480th ISR Wing.

Mission | Empower Airmen to Action as They Solve, Air, Space and Cyber Problems
Spartan leaders at all levels will be radical, but smart delegators of authority. Every Spartan will own
their challenge, own the way to overcome that challenge, and own the glory or managed defeat to be
ready for the next opportunity. Spartans will be part of a disciplined and agile force focused on
delivering Air-centered ISR to decision makers at all levels whenever duty calls. Spartan excellence will
be feared by the enemy and renowned by our allies.
